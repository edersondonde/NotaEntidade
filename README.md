# Nota Entidade

Nota Entidade is a software made to help charity institution on the processing of invoices in the program "Nota Fiscal Paulista" of São Paulo, Brazil.

Nota Fiscal Paulista is a governmnet program that refunds part of the taxes if you ask for the invoices. However, those invoices not claimed can be donated to Charity Institutions, that can use those invoices to get the tax refund.

However, the processing of the invoices is manual, until invoices with QrCode became available, and now you can read and export the invoice just by reading the QrCode.

Nota Entidade is an Android App, part of a series of tools to help on the task of reading and exporting invoices to the NFP program. You can know more about it in the site http://notaentidade.blogspot.com.br/.
